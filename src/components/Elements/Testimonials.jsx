        review: 'We asked these guys for a composite deck and pergola for our newly built house. They have created an amazing outdoor space that we love and will make memories in for many years to come. Nathanâ€™s knowledge of products and recommendations for those that would give us the look we were after was the reason they won our quote.'

        review: "From the very start, Nathan from Monumental Building came in with a welcoming and positive energy. I received several quotes that were extremely overpriced and put doubt in my mind I would be able to achieve what I was after with the budget I had but luckily I was able to meet someone like Nathan. As this was the first time I've ever done any sort of renovation work, Nathan was kind enough to provide me with as much help and advice he could offer. He went above and beyond to help me achieve the goals I was after and did a fantastic carpentry job. His level of craftsmen and professionalism cannot be measured. I highly recommend anyone to use Nathan for all their renovation works."
